Support Agent Chatbot for CDP
This project is a Support Agent Chatbot designed to provide intelligent, real-time assistance to users interacting with a Customer Data Platform (CDP). The chatbot helps users query customer data, troubleshoot issues, and find answers to common questions about the platform. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with a simple chatbot framework), the project aims to enhance the user experience by offering quick support without the need for direct human intervention.

Features
Real-time Assistance: The chatbot responds instantly to user queries, improving the support process.
Customer Data Queries: Users can ask the chatbot about customer profiles, behaviors, audience segments, and more from different CDP platforms (e.g., Segment, mParticle, Lytics, Zeotap).
Intelligent Responses: Based on the query, the chatbot generates responses related to the platform (Segment, mParticle, Lytics, Zeotap) and provides helpful links for more information.
Customizable Knowledge Base: The chatbot includes responses for common queries, but can easily be extended with more data or platforms.
User Interaction: The chatbot interface allows for easy interaction via an input box, where users can type their queries and receive responses.
Technologies Used
Frontend:
HTML: For creating the structure and layout of the chatbot.
CSS: For styling the chatbot interface.
JavaScript: For managing the chatbot logic and providing dynamic interaction.
Backend (Optional):
If you plan to expand the chatbot with backend features, you can integrate it with a server-side framework such as Spring Boot to handle more advanced functionality (e.g., storing chat history, integrating with a live support system).
NLP (Optional):
Dialogflow or IBM Watson for advanced natural language processing, enabling the bot to handle more complex queries.
Setup & Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
Open index.html in your browser:

You can directly open the index.html file in your browser to view the chatbot interface.
Customizing Responses:

Open the script.js file to add, remove, or edit responses to common queries.
The chatbot currently supports basic queries related to Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. You can add more platforms or modify the existing ones.
Usage
Once the page is opened, users can type their queries into the input field and click the Send button (or press Enter) to send the query to the chatbot.
The chatbot will then search for relevant responses based on the user's input and display them in the chat window.
The bot provides helpful links to external documentation for more detailed information on each platform.
